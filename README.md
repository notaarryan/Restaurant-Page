# 🍔 BURGER - Modern Single Page Restaurant Website

A single-page restaurant website built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
This project is part of my web development journey, demonstrating clean component-based architecture, dynamic DOM manipulation, and modern design.

---

## ✨ Features

- Single Page Application (SPA) structure using vanilla JavaScript
- Dynamic page switching (Home, Menu, About) without reloading
- Modular, component-based design (`Home`, `Menu`, `About`)
- Responsive and modern styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Smooth transitions and hover effects for an engaging user experience
- Uses local storage to remember which page was last opened and loads that page when the site is reopened

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** – Dynamic rendering and event handling
- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Modern responsive design and animations
- **Webpack** – Bundling assets (images, CSS, JS)
